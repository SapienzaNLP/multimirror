# MultiMirror: Neural Cross-lingual Word Alignment for Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation

This repo hosts the resources released in [MultiMirror: Neural Cross-lingual Word Alignment for Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/539), 
a paper we presented at IJCAI 2021. MultiMirror is a cross-lingual sense projection approach for multilingual WSD based on a novel discriminative
word alignment model. The sense-tagged datasets it produces lead a standard WSD classifier to achieve state-of-the-art performances
on established benchmarks in French, German, Italian, Spanish and Japanese.

In *data/mwsd/* you can find instructions to download the generated sense-tagged corpora in the afore-mentioned languages.
Furthermore, *data/alignment/* also reports how to download the manually-annotated word alignments datasets we produced for
French, German, Italian and Spanish.

To train the WSD models, we suggest using [wsd](https://github.com/edobobo/wsd), the library we developed for WSD classification.
